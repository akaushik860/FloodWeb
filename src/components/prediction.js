          Flood forecasting is the estimation of future water levels or flows at
          a single or multiple sites of a river system for different lead times.
          Precise and reliable forecasting is important for flood warning, flood
          control planning, and rehabilitation. Of the several models available
          for flood forecasting, soft computing techniqueâ€“based models are often
          better in terms of accuracy and reliability for operational flood
          forecasting systems, irrespective of data scarcity issues.
